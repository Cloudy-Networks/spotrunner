## spotrunner


### development environment

The  **/bootstrap_developement_env**
folder contains CloudFormation stacks and scripts used to quickly setup a development environment to use aid in testing spotrunner. It provides an instance in a standalone VPC with a simple  static web app as well as a simple mechanism to simulate the "instance-action" API endpoint that AWS uses for providing terminating/stopping interrupts for spot instance. See the README in the folder for more details.
